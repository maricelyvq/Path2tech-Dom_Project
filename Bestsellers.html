            <p class="description">
                Ava Carter has always been the perfect daughter—the brilliant young Black woman who landed a coveted role as a NASA data scientist straight out of grad school. But beneath the accolades and stability, she feels trapped. The numbers and codes don’t move her the way music does. Late at night, she finds herself lost in the hypnotic beats of melodic techno and the soul-stirring rhythms of R&B, secretly crafting mixes and dreaming of a life behind the decks.
                Will she stay in orbit, bound by expectations, or risk it all to chase the music calling her soul?
